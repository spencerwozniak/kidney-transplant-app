# Kidney Transplant Navigation | Mobile App

Patient-facing mobile app that helps dialysis patients understand, track, and navigate the kidney transplant pathway using **patient-owned data**, **clear explanations**, and **actionable next steps**.

This app is designed to function independently of dialysis facilities and puts patients in control of their own health information.
